# <h1 align=center>Working of project</h1>
- This project is mainly divided in frontend and backend. 
## Frontend

The frontend application is built with **React** and leverages **Redux** for state management. The design incorporates **Tailwind CSS** for styling and includes features like:
- A sidebar to manage multiple chat sessions.
- A responsive chat interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- Markdown-to-HTML conversion for rendering messages.
- A fallback mode with default content when chat mode is disabled.

Detailed documentation for the frontend can be found inside the [frontend directory](./frontend/)

## Backend

This backend API acts as a bridge between the client application and Langflow. It facilitates the processing of user prompts, communicates with Langflow, and returns structured responses to the client. The API is designed to handle errors gracefully and ensure seamless interaction.
